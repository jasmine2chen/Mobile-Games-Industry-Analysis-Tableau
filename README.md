# Mobile Games Industry Analysis with Tableau

## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze an open Kaggle open dataset "17K Mobile Strategy Games" with Tableau. I performed data wrangling using Python. I created dashboard to investigate the following relationships:
- Price Yearly Trend
- Size Yearly Trend
- Size vs User Rating (Grouped by Genre)
- Price vs User Rating (Grouped by Genre)
- Size vs Price (Grouped by Genre)

## Dataset
The dataset contains 17,007 strategy games on the Apple App Store, and was collected on the 3rd of August 2019, using the iTunes API and the App Store sitemap. <https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games>
