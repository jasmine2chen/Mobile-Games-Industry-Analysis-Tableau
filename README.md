# Mobile Games Industry Analysis with Tableau

## Overview
The mobile games industry is worth billions of dollars, with companies spending vast amounts of money on the development and marketing of these games. The goal of this project is to analyze a sub-market: strategy games, by using an open Kaggle open dataset "17K Mobile Strategy Games". I performed data wrangling using Python, and created dashboard to investigate the following relationships:
- Price Yearly Trend
- Size Yearly Trend
- Size vs User Rating (Grouped by Genre)
- Price vs User Rating (Grouped by Genre)
- Size vs Price (Grouped by Genre)

## Dataset
The dataset contains 17,007 strategy games on the Apple App Store, and was collected on the 3rd of August 2019, using the iTunes API and the App Store sitemap.
